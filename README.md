## Analyzing Distinctions in Popularity of Different Contents using Reddit

### Introduction
<p align="justify">
With the rapid adoption of content sharing websites people share contents of their choice and vote or comment on contents shared by other or those that are of theirs. Reddit is one such content sharing platforms in which users can post content, upvote or downvote content and comment on posts made by others. Users post their content on sub-groups/ social communities called subreddits which are dedicated to share information of a specific type as described on the subreddit page. Subreddits are moderated and reviewed for content through policies enforced by Reddit and subreddit moderators. Reddit posts/ submissions are of two types mostly, they are either links to third party content or self generated content by the user.

It would be interesting to study and observe what aspects of a content causes it to be virally discussed in societies. To be specific, do different content types have different aspects that influence its virality, how should contents be structured and placed on social communities such as subreddits such that they are more popularly discussed within the community. Does moderation influence the extent to which contents of different type can be discussed on communities? Does subreddit member community perception about content influence popularity?

### Project Description

<p align="justify">
In this project,a preliminary research was conducted to
examine factors such as content similarity, content length,
time of submission and other such features in relation with
the number of comments a submission receives. This study
provides a better understanding of associations
between content structure, member influence, community
moderation and content popularity.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The main research question in this study was, <b>Are different
content- self generated vs blog links vs news links,
popular due to similar influences of user, community,
  content and time aspects?</b> We developed models to predict
content popularity based on the number of comments it
received. We also compared across different content types
as to what features influence popularity.

This project was done as part of the coursework for
CSC2552- Topics in Computational Social Science during
Winter 2019 at University of Torronto.
